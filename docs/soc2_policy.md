# SOC 2 Compliance Policy

## Overview

OpenMonetization-UserAcquisition (OMUA) implements SOC 2 Type II compliance measures to ensure the security, availability, and integrity of customer data. This document outlines our SOC 2 compliance framework and implementation.

## SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

### Security (Required)
- **Access Controls**: Multi-layered access control with role-based permissions
- **Encryption**: Database encryption using SQLCipher with configurable passphrases
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all system activities
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting for security events

### Availability
- **System Reliability**: High availability architecture with automatic failover
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of system performance metrics
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backup procedures with encryption
- **Disaster Recovery**: Documented recovery procedures and testing

### Integrity
- **Data Integrity**: Hash-based integrity checking for critical data
- **Process Integrity**: Validation of system processes and workflows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Implementation Details

### 1. Audit Logging

All system activities are logged with the following information:
- **Event ID**: Unique identifier for each audit event
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 formatted timestamp with microsecond precision
- **User ID**: Identifier of the user or system component performing the action
- **Action**: The specific action performed (create, read, update, delete, etc.)
- **Resource Type**: Type of resource being accessed (workflow, experiment, etc.)
- **Resource ID**: Specific identifier of the resource
- **IP Address**: Source IP address (when applicable)
- **User Agent**: Client user agent string (when applicable)
- **Integrity Hash**: SHA-256 hash of the audit record for tamper detection

#### Audit Log Storage
- Audit logs are stored separately from operational data
- Logs are encrypted at rest using the same encryption as operational data
- Logs are retained for a minimum of 7 years for SOC 2 compliance
- Log integrity is verified through hash chaining

### 2. Data Encryption

#### At-Rest Encryption
- SQLite databases are encrypted using SQLCipher with AES-256 encryption
- Encryption keys are managed through secure configuration
- All sensitive data fields are encrypted before storage

#### In-Transit Encryption
- All API communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- Internal service communications are encrypted
- Database connections use encrypted protocols when available

#### Key Management
- Encryption keys are derived from user-provided passphrases using PBKDF2
- Keys are never stored in plaintext
- Key rotation procedures are documented and implemented

### 3. Access Controls

#### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication support for administrative access
- Secure password policies with complexity requirements
- Session management with automatic timeout

#### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Principle of least privilege applied to all system access
- Regular access reviews and permission audits

#### Network Security
- Firewall rules limiting access to necessary ports only
- VPN requirements for administrative access
- Network segmentation between environments

### 4. Security Monitoring

#### Real-time Monitoring
- Security event monitoring with immediate alerts
- Intrusion detection system integration
- Log analysis for anomalous behavior

#### Incident Response
- Documented incident response procedures
- 24/7 monitoring for critical security events
- Regular incident response training and simulations

### 5. Data Backup and Recovery

#### Backup Procedures
- Automated daily backups of all system data
- Encrypted backup storage with integrity verification
- Backup testing procedures documented and executed regularly

#### Recovery Testing
- Annual disaster recovery testing
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) defined
- Failover procedures tested quarterly

## Compliance Controls

### Administrative Controls
- Regular security awareness training for all personnel
- Background checks for employees with access to sensitive data
- Third-party vendor risk assessments

### Technical Controls
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Regular security patch management
- Code review requirements for security-critical changes

### Physical Controls
- Secure data center facilities with access controls
- Environmental monitoring and redundant power systems
- Secure disposal procedures for hardware

## Audit and Assessment

### Internal Audits
- Quarterly internal security assessments
- Annual SOC 2 readiness assessments
- Continuous monitoring and improvement

### External Audits
- Annual SOC 2 Type II audits by independent auditors
- Penetration testing by certified security professionals
- Code security reviews by third-party experts

## Compliance Monitoring

### Metrics and KPIs
- Security incident response time (< 1 hour for critical incidents)
- Audit log coverage (100% of system activities)
- Backup success rate (> 99.9%)
- System availability (> 99.9%)

### Reporting
- Monthly compliance status reports
- Quarterly board-level security reports
- Annual SOC 2 audit reports

## Incident Management

### Security Incidents
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Initial impact assessment within 1 hour
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems within 4 hours
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems using documented procedures
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

### Data Breaches
1. **Notification**: Regulatory notifications within 72 hours
2. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis of breach scope and impact
3. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and security improvements
4. **Communication**: Affected party notifications as required

## Change Management

### Security Changes
- All security-related changes require formal approval
- Change testing in non-production environments
- Rollback procedures documented and tested

### Code Changes
- Security code reviews required for all changes
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Vulnerability scanning before deployment

## Third-Party Risk Management

### Vendor Assessments
- Security questionnaires for all third-party vendors
- Contractual SOC 2 requirements where applicable
- Regular vendor risk assessments

### Supply Chain Security
- Secure software supply chain practices
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Open source license compliance

## Continuous Improvement

### Security Program Enhancement
- Annual security program review and updates
- Adoption of new security technologies and practices
- Regular training and awareness updates

### Compliance Maturity
- SOC 2 compliance as foundation for other frameworks
- ISO 27001 certification roadmap
- Industry-specific compliance requirements
